# BTS Concert ticket fluctuation analysis

In this project, my colleague, Nathaniel, and I will be gathering info from Ticketmaster to analyze how much the resale ticket prices for the Saturday, April 9, 2022 [BTS Concert](https://www.ticketmaster.com/bts-permission-to-dance-on-stage-las-vegas-nevada-04-09-2022/event/17005C55B2C41B9C) will fluctuate 5 days before the concert.

The data scraped from the will be stored the in the `seats` and `prices` JSON files, nested within a folder labeled with the time we gathered the data.

More code will be added later about how we parsed these JSON files. Stay tuned! (:
